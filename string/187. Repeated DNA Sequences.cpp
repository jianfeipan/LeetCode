The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

 well int he begining I think there was one algo for searching prefix or something else, but I don't remember. then I think we can do a brut force, then I realize that this is a good solution.
