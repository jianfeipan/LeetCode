Description
Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth smallest element in it.

What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?


- can we make change of the BST modificationsï¼Ÿ K is a more static value, I mean we can design the tree as a tree with left side always have K element, so every time the kth smallest is the root
when you do remove or insertion, just make sure the insertion and remove make the rotation of the root to keep k element on left.

good: quick access the kth smallest number
bad : tree is not well balanced and impact the efficiety of search

- we can add a count number in the node: to count the index from left, insert and remove will update these count in node.
